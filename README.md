# koa-redux

Redux, Typescript, React practise app served by Koa

The idea is to experiment with some things I've either grown very rusty with
or have no idea how to use.

This code is not fit for any use other than maybe learning what not to do.

## Building

`yarn build`

## Running

Run the development server. Make sure to build the project first.
`yarn server`

## Cleaning up

Run this to clean up any files that might have been left behind during development.
`yarn clean`
